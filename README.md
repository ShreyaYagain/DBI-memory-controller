# DBI-memory-controller
A hardware-based memory controller designed in **Verilog HDL** that applies **Data Bus Inversion (DBI)** to reduce power consumption and improve performance.  
This project demonstrates how DBI can minimize bit transitions on a data bus, lowering dynamic power usage without compromising bandwidth.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **DBI Implementation**: Reduces switching activity on memory buses.  
- **Simulation**: Testbenches run on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/).  
- **Results**:  
  - significant reduction in power consumption  
  - bandwidth improvement  
  - Integrated paralell processing for faster processes
